## Synopsis

This project evaluates Amazon AWS Api.

## Code Example

Set your AWS credentials(Make sure you have all permissions to access the services.) on ~/.aws/credentials.
If you don't provide "profileName" to respective APIExplorer classes, it by default uses "Default" profile.
Use the Driver class to evaluate AWS API code.

## Motivation

I had written this code to understand Amazon AWS API in a better way and to achieve below goals.

1) I want to improve my Java coding. I want to write elegant code. This code is not perfect, but it definitely is my way to push one step forward than current status.
<<<<<<< HEAD
2) I want to explore Amazon AWS API to design better AWS Security Products and help customers to solve their issues.
3) I want to develop AWS API wrapper products and this code is my effort to eventually develop elegant AWS API Wrapper products.

## Installation

Clone the source code and import into Eclipse as Maven project.
Please check Driver classes which call the Amazon AWS Wrapper API's.

## API Reference

This code is written using "aws-java-sdk" version "1.11.8". Checkout AWS Java API reference.

## Tests

<<<<<<< HEAD
No test code had been written for this project due to time constraint. My main goal is to understand Amazon API in better way, so I had mainly focused on this goal.
